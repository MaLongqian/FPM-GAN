# FPM-GAN
FPM-GAN is a craniofacial reconstruction model that learns skull–face correspondence using a frequency-perception generator and multi-scale discriminator. With semi-wavelet attention, high–low frequency decomposition, and adaptive loss, it improves global structure and local texture restoration.
